# Learner Quest

This project only exists as a benchmark for my current progress with C++. That is to say that the code within this project is likely not the best standards and could be improved, massively. I'm publishing this for the sake of openness and nothing more.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a simple 2D adventure game template that showcases my understanding of various programming concepts and game development techniques. This project is published purely for educational and demonstrative purposes.

### Current features

- 2D rendering using SDL2
- Simplistic game loop
- Event input handling
- "Scene" switching
- Scenes with overridable logic
- UI text rendering
- Scene backgrounds

### Roadmap

- Scene transitions
- Scene "prefabs" and elements
- UI interaction
- 2D collision physics
- Player objects
- Element frame animation
- Audio loop
